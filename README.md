# Supervised Lerning Project
This repository is to present the final project of the Introduction of Machine Learning Course.

This project is to present the machine learning process including the EDA, data cleaning, preprocessing, feature selection, hyperparamete tuning, ensemble, and evaluation. 

The models in the project are the decision tree, bagging, random forest, adaboost, and gradient boost.

The dataset is the titanic dataset from the seaborn library.
