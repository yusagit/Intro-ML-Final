# Supervised Lerning Project
This repository is to present the final project of the Introduction of Machine Learning Course.

The machine learning process in this project includes the EDA, data cleaning, preprocessing, feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, ensemble, and evaluation. 

The models in the project are the decision tree, bagging, random forest, adaboost, and gradient boost.

The dataset is the titanic dataset from the seaborn library.
